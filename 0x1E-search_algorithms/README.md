# Search Algorithms

## What is a search algorithm?

In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.

Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys. 

## What is a linear search?

Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.
Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.

## What is a binary search?

Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.

## What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs?

I guess the question pretty much answers itself, to be honest...

The appropriate search algorithm to use often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. Search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures, such as search trees, hash maps, and database indexes.
